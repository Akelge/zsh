File 99-local.zsh is autocreated in zsh.d and zsh.d/$KERNEL

Useful customizations that you can add are

prompt <promptname> - redefine prompt

To use virtualenvs you MUST define
export WORKON_HOME <path to virtualenvs>
export PROJECT_HOME <path to projects>

then you can explicitly call 'venv' or leave it as a function to invoke at the
right moment
